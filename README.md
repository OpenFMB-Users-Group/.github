## The OpenFMB Open Source Initiative

This OpenFMB Users Group GitHub Organization serves as the official GitHub site for open source projects sponsored by the OpenFMB Users Group. It is the companion site to OpenFMB’s primary community site ([https://openfmb.net/](https://openfmb.net/)).

The OpenFMB Open Source Initiative is dedicated to providing open source projects and tooling that benefit the OpenFMB community at large with commercially friendly licenses. Our gaol is to:

- Provide awareness of OpenFMB open source projects and tooling
- Promote open source projects that help advance OpenFMB and OpenFMB related standards
- Provide a central repository for OpenFMB related open source projects and tooling
- Provide a space for promoting collaboration around these projects within the OpenFMB community

To inquire about the OpenFMB Open Source Initiative or to discuss contributing new projects to the initiative please contact us at [github.admin@ucaiug.org](mailto:github.admin@ucaiug.org).

## OpenFMB Users Group

### Our Mission

The OpenFMB standard is community driven. OpenFMB provides its use-cases, data models, device interfaces, and test procedures with a royalty-free, open-source license. It is maintained by an active nonprofit users’ group sharing the same parent organization (UCAIug) and governance processes as other leading energy interoperability standards: IEC 61850 and the Common Information Model (CIM). 

### About OpenFMB Users Group

The OpenFMB users’ group is comprised of a diverse mix of energy industry stakeholders including electric utilities, hardware and software vendors, research labs, federal government, and consultants.  These dedicated individuals contribute as they are able and participate in activities based on interest and ability. 

### What is the OpenFMB and why is it needed?​

The Open Field Message Bus (OpenFMB) is a grid-edge interoperability standard that specifies common data models and unified protocol interfaces to democratize the utility ecosystem and enable distributed intelligence use-cases. OpenFMB reduces the need for centralized control and allows management of distribution systems at the circuit level. 

OpenFMB also provides plug-n-play adapters to leading energy protocols (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, 2030.5, and OCPP), which enable federated data exchanges at the edge of the network and allow for secure peer-to-peer communication in a heterogeneous ecosystem of hardware devices and software applications.

OpenFMB is developed by an industry coalition of energy stakeholders within the UCA International Users Group, the OpenFMB data model was derived from IEC 61850 and IEC 61968/61970 (Common Information Model) and is publicly available in Unified Modeling Language (UML).
